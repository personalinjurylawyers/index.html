<p>Billable hours are seen in the debate over past few years
including some popular scandals and lawsuits including big firms like DLA Piper
over legal billing. Typically such disputes and claims clients either refuse to
pay the bill or law firms are accused of unnecessary work. </p>



<p>The number of such disputes is increasing thus contributing
a suspicious environment between lawyer and client relationship. Mostly, large
companies have huge overheads and they have to charge higher fees to cover
their expense. Therefore, clients are willing to pay higher fees in return for quality
service and deep representation skills. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lawcurt.com/contents/data/2019/06/Billable-Hours.jpg" alt="Billable hours" class="wp-image-474" srcset="https://lawcurt.com/contents/data/2019/06/Billable-Hours.jpg 710w, https://lawcurt.com/contents/data/2019/06/Billable-Hours-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></figure>



<p>Each new dispute periodically contributes to hourly billing
debate and consequently discussions for a change. But over the years such cases
erupt and then people forget or they can do nothing about to change it. A
respectable and highly experienced attorney at a reputable firm shares his
opinion on an occasion where he says;</p>



<p>Big Law firms inherit much deeper problems within their
business model. Moreover, he adds that just like former scandals on billing,
the current disputes will also pass away and hourly billing will live.</p>



<p>It’s not just a billable-hour system which is leading an environment
of mistrust in community and law firms rather it involves a complete system. Where
reputable law firms offer rewards to partners and associates for working at
high hours. There are multiple other things which now become an operating
culture at our law firms.</p>



<p>The change to all this can only occur if courts announce any
decision to back away from billable hour policies, clients strictly start to
force for alternative way of billing, market leaders (law firms) starts to
behave in a manner where they quit looking to increase short-term revenues and
avoid any such directions for partners also.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if we look into this issue from a community
perspective then hourly billing contributes towards the higher legal cost. This
approach of billing makes the law firms at the safe side where all the risk of
achieving goals or not lies with the client. However, some instance are
available where law firms share the benefits with clients in case they win over
claims and in case they lose there are no charges. </p>



<p>In the long run, such scandals just contribute to making the
image of lawyers and law firms a bit suspicious. Moreover, it also strengthens
the perception among the general community that lawyers overbill their clients
typically and they must ask questions on invoices and their work. </p>



<p>All such scenarios empower a client to think about methods
and controls to scrutinize the billing by using a number of means. However, all
such outcry on billable hours just undermines the trust-ability of lawyers
among the general public. </p>

<p>A balance between state power against individual rights in
the world of the internet is necessary to keep everything at the proper place. Every
state has set up its online snooping laws to deal with cases and to support the
investigatory powers against the citizen’s rights. The objective is to improve
the transparency in the whole process and more importantly legal certainty. </p>



<p>Online surveillance laws typically aim to regulate online activity, more importantly, the role of social media is in focus under such practices. It’s a common discussion among common people that such laws and policies oppose the basic rights of privacy and free speech. But in reality, such laws tend to cover up both positive and negative sides of basic rights. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lawcurt.com/contents/data/2019/06/Online-surveillance-law.jpg" alt="Online surveillance law" class="wp-image-378" srcset="https://lawcurt.com/contents/data/2019/06/Online-surveillance-law.jpg 710w, https://lawcurt.com/contents/data/2019/06/Online-surveillance-law-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></figure>



<p>For instance, if we think about the recent data protection
laws (GDPR), then you will see it attempts to protect citizens in term of
information breach or theft by using illegal techniques or means. On the other
side, this data protection also helps law enforcement agencies to take down,
block, or remove websites or apps that are violating and breaching consumer
privacy.</p>



<p>In all over the world, most countries even third world
countries including India do also have rules in place to monitor and regulate
the information passing over via the internet or other channels. However, each
country deals with different aspects of complexities with unlike means.
Therefore, one has to consult a professional before inducing any type of judgment
or taking any decision. </p>



<p>In 2013, it goes public that the government of the USA and
UK are collecting consumer data. Furthermore, the claims were that the USA is
operating PRISM and UPSTREAM while UK is operating TEMPORA for data collection.
</p>



<p>The aim of such programs is to anticipate the future needs
and understanding of current conditions. The data collected under such programs
is increasing its size by 10x every 5 years. Moreover, the mobile sensors data,
social media pulses, and other user behavior are also growing. </p>



<p>Online surveillance laws or online snooping laws always
initiate a debate in the community where some people are in the right of the
bill while some are against it. But in all cases, the government is found
contending for cybercrime, terrorism, data breach, and darknet risks and most
importantly crimes associated with these activities.</p>



<p>As stated earlier most states have such regulations and laws
in place and it’s not just the USA or UK. Such laws require the service
providers to collect and intercept the data and store it separate for the
potential probability of use in any upcoming crime investigation. Moreover, all
businesses and consumers then have to follow the rules set by such regulations
and especially business owners have to fulfill all mentioned requirements for
smooth operations.</p>
