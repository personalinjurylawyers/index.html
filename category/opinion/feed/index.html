<p>A balance between state power against individual rights in
the world of the internet is necessary to keep everything at the proper place. Every
state has set up its online snooping laws to deal with cases and to support the
investigatory powers against the citizen’s rights. The objective is to improve
the transparency in the whole process and more importantly legal certainty. </p>



<p>Online surveillance laws typically aim to regulate online activity, more importantly, the role of social media is in focus under such practices. It’s a common discussion among common people that such laws and policies oppose the basic rights of privacy and free speech. But in reality, such laws tend to cover up both positive and negative sides of basic rights. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://lawcurt.com/contents/data/2019/06/Online-surveillance-law.jpg" alt="Online surveillance law" class="wp-image-378" srcset="https://lawcurt.com/contents/data/2019/06/Online-surveillance-law.jpg 710w, https://lawcurt.com/contents/data/2019/06/Online-surveillance-law-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 710px) 100vw, 710px" /></figure>



<p>For instance, if we think about the recent data protection
laws (GDPR), then you will see it attempts to protect citizens in term of
information breach or theft by using illegal techniques or means. On the other
side, this data protection also helps law enforcement agencies to take down,
block, or remove websites or apps that are violating and breaching consumer
privacy.</p>



<p>In all over the world, most countries even third world
countries including India do also have rules in place to monitor and regulate
the information passing over via the internet or other channels. However, each
country deals with different aspects of complexities with unlike means.
Therefore, one has to consult a professional before inducing any type of judgment
or taking any decision. </p>



<p>In 2013, it goes public that the government of the USA and
UK are collecting consumer data. Furthermore, the claims were that the USA is
operating PRISM and UPSTREAM while UK is operating TEMPORA for data collection.
</p>



<p>The aim of such programs is to anticipate the future needs
and understanding of current conditions. The data collected under such programs
is increasing its size by 10x every 5 years. Moreover, the mobile sensors data,
social media pulses, and other user behavior are also growing. </p>



<p>Online surveillance laws or online snooping laws always
initiate a debate in the community where some people are in the right of the
bill while some are against it. But in all cases, the government is found
contending for cybercrime, terrorism, data breach, and darknet risks and most
importantly crimes associated with these activities.</p>



<p>As stated earlier most states have such regulations and laws
in place and it’s not just the USA or UK. Such laws require the service
providers to collect and intercept the data and store it separate for the
potential probability of use in any upcoming crime investigation. Moreover, all
businesses and consumers then have to follow the rules set by such regulations
and especially business owners have to fulfill all mentioned requirements for
smooth operations.</p>
