<p>An affidavit of domicile is typically utilized after someone is dead to find their residence place. It is a legal document which is typically created by the estate executor or financial brokers with the purpose of ownership transfer. </p>



<p>Affidavit of domicile is must when an estate ownership transfer includes bonds, stocks and other securities. Otherwise, the ownership will not be transferred if you don’t have an affidavit of domicile. In other situations sometimes banks also require the beneficiaries to submit an affidavit of domicile for ownership transfer. </p>

<p>A late rent notice is a legal document sent over from landlord to tenant demanding/requesting any recent rent which is not paid by tenant. Moreover, this form is considered as the first legal document to send a tenant before sending him/her an eviction notice.</p>



<p>Estate/property owner typically, use this form when the tenant has failed to pay rent. Moreover, if the tenant is still neglecting and not paying the rent then at the next step you will send him/her Eviction Notice to end the agreement.</p>



<p>It is already agreed in the lease agreement that by which method landlord will send the notices to the tenant. Most typically people use delivery in person, send by postal service, and send via registered mail. Besides that, what’s the right time to send a late rent notice? It is a common question comes in mind. The owner of the property can send LATE RENT NOTICE as the due date for rent has passed while reminding the tenant and give some extra time, which is typically 3-5 days to pay rent. </p>
